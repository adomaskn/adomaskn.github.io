        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-section-content">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Pre-Uni days</h3>
          <div class="body-text">
            From my early days, the topics that I have been most interested in were Mathematics, Geography, Physics, and Chemistry.
            In school, I participated in many national competitions and olympiads to test my skills and I was proficient in these subjects.<br>
            Given my current involvement in programming, it might be surprising to learn that I didn't study it at all during my school years.
            To be honest, I did learn some web development, but it wasn't my favorite.
            However, I had a keen interest in computers themselves and built my own computer from scratch when I was around 15, following a Linus Tech Tips tutorial.
            Back then, I was an avid gamer and wanted to upgrade from my PS3 to play more exciting games.<br>
            In addition to all of the aforementioned, I was also in a choir from the 1st grade to the 12th and started playing football around the age of 9.
            The final grades of my school exams were: 100 for Mathematics and English, 91 for Physics, 84 for Geography, 67 for Lithuanian and Chemistry.
          </div>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Uni days</h3>
          <div class="body-text">
            I chose the topic that I am going to be studying on a whim. I couldn't decide between Physics and Mathematics, but the latter got my first pick and I got accepted to Vilnius University.
            My start at the uni (2019) wasn't the best and I even managed to fail a combinatorics class in my first semester (I completed it in an exam retake, so not a big deal).
            The atmosphere was truly different when compared to school and I struggled with some of my duties at first, but after a few semesters got the hang of it all.
            The global pandemic which showed it's full force during the end of my first uni year surprisingly helped my in the academic way because during times of no lectures
            and staying away from my home city with only my new found girlfriend at my side I learned that studying is mainly done on your own.
            This revelation helped me drastically and changed my view of the world in some ways because now I knew that the only person that can push you towards your goals is YOU.<br>
            Not to mention uni provided me with something very valuable - basic understanding of programming and its capabilities. 
            The first course on Informatics was quite a struggle for me because we had to learn Python and without any prior knowledge it looked quite scary from my point of view.
            Only after about a year of learning it I saw the HUGE capabilities that Python (or any similar language) holds. Then I started to learn it on my phone using the <a href="https://mimo.org/">Mimo app</a> and didn't look back.

                - PROJECT_NAME: the name of the project (keep it short, it only shows 1 line)
                - SMALL_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION: a quick project description (max 4 lines)
                - PROJECT_PAGE_NAME.html: the html filename for the project (must be in project-pages folder)
